# yvm

An A/D-CTF service revolving around a toy JVM written in OCaml that was played
at [ENOWARS 7](https://ctftime.org/event/2040).

The service was written in the context of a university course.

- `service/` contains the service. This folder was deployed on the vulnboxes.
- `checker/` contains the [checker](https://enowars.github.io/docs/service/getting-started/#checker).

See [documentation/README.md](documentation/README.md) for architecture, features and vulns.
